<!-- # Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.  -->

# First Milestone
  

MY first milestone was getting the motors to work work in order to spin the wheel of the robot. I was able to do this using an arduino, an H-bridge, and a battery pack. I coded the arduino to send data to the H-bridge which is what ,akes the motor spin and the battery pack was incharge of powering everything.
A problem that I encounter while doing this was that somo mottors were spinning clockwise while others were spinning countercloclkwise which made the robot spin instead of move foward. However I was able to solve this after fixing some problems with my code.
