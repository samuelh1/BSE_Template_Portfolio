<!-- # Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.  -->

# Second Milestone

My second milestone was getting the robot to stop whenever theres an obstacle within 20 centimeters. I was able to do this by connecting the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves at a frequency above human hearing through the trig pin. The sound waves bounce off of the nearest obstacle and are received again by the echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor.Base on the amount of time that it takes for the waves to bounce back the ultrasonic sensor is able to determine the distance from the closest obstacle.

# First Milestone
  

MY first milestone was getting the motors to work work in order to spin the wheel of the robot. I was able to do this using an arduino, an H-bridge, and a battery pack. I coded the arduino to send data to the H-bridge which is what ,akes the motor spin and the battery pack was incharge of powering everything.
A problem that I encounter while doing this was that somo mottors were spinning clockwise while others were spinning countercloclkwise which made the robot spin instead of move foward. However I was able to solve this after fixing some problems with my code.
